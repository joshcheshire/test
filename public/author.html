                            <h3 class = "aboutBody">Dr. Richard D. Cheshire is a leadership organizer. His career has been about the practice and teaching of transformative leadership, as a college administrator and professor, president of The University of Tampa, author of Leading by Heart, vice president for development of the Center for Strategic & International Studies, executive director of the Shakespeare Globe Centre of North America, and a co-founder of the Council for Advancement and Support of Education. He holds that winning hearts and minds works by the same principles in macro-international affairs as in micro-interpersonal relations, and that these principles are universal, the essence of civic virtue among all peoples. His degrees are from Colgate University, the University of New Hampshire, and New York University. He is married, with three children, eight grandchildren, and two great grandchildren.</h3>
