      <h2 class = "opEdHeaders">Indomitable Quest, Not War</h2><br>
        <p class = "opEdBody">
          America leads a quest for freedom, not a war against unfreedom. That’s the message of the Preamble of the U.S. Constitution. This quest is indomitable because it is in the nature of civilized people.<br><br> 

          That is why the Preamble should be the first plank in the political platforms of both national parties and why it should be the first promise of every presidential candidate. It is why it should be the first thought on the minds of every prospective voter.<br><br>  
          
          The Constitution begins with a single sentence: the Preamble. It says, in the words of our founders: “We the People, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty, to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.”<br><br> 

          This charge is a doctrine of freedom. It frames the Supreme Law of the Land. It is the order to which our leaders are pledged. It embodies our founding ideals. It embraces our national purpose. It encapsulates the American Dream.<br><br> 

          When we vote for the next President, we will also vote for the next Congress, and most likely, for the next Supreme Court. They will all take an oath of office to defend and protect the Constitution.<br><br> 

America is not at war with terrorists, but rather we are in the fight of our lives. It is the moral equivalent of war, an indomitable freedom quest for all people; a struggle for civilization over decadence – the rule of cruel. We must lead that quest, along with our partner nations, because we should and we can.It is our founding doctrine.<br><br> 

As a member of the United Nations, we are also pledged – with the U.N.’s other signatories – to ensure freedom across the globe. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the General Assembly in 1948, bestows the responsibility to respect human dignity globally. That is the essence of freedom.<br><br>  

We the People will soon elect a new president. Will we be electing the next leader of the free world? That person will be elected on promises. Will they be promises of freedom – with rights and responsibilities for everyone? Will that kind of freedom produce the promises for all the people or just for the powerful? Will it unify our differences or perpetuate them? Will it bring justice or inequality? Will it create tranquility or fear? Will it promote our defense or put us on the attack? Will we have welfare or warfare?<br><br> 


Will it secure the blessings of liberty or impose the limits of servitude? Will the freedom created be just for ourselves or for our children? Will it abide by the law or create disorder? For America alone or for the rest of the world as well? Now is the time to revisit the Preamble.<br><br> 

Our mutual quest for freedom is indomitable – the seed of our creativity as a people. The Preamble foresees our solidarity as one people. This leads to the security of all people. It recalls the words of the Declaration of Independence: “That all men are created equal . . . with certain inalienable rights . . . life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.”<br><br> 

The Declaration states that if these rights are not respected by the government, the people have the right to install a new government that respects the will of the people. This indomitable quest for freedom – not fear – deserves our vote. Freedom is not the rule of the cruel. Freedom is the rule of the cool. </p><br>

  <h2 class = "opEdHeaders">Freedom or Fearsome</h2><br>
        <p class = "opEdBody">The Washington Post recently reported that the United States has been found to be the fourth best country in the world. This was announced on January 20 by Mortimer B. Zuckerman, chairman and editor-in-chief of the U.S. News & World Report at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. He said: “Just as we have done with universities, hospitals and other institutions, our Best Countries portal will be a global homepage for stories and data to help citizens, business leaders, and governments evaluate performance in a rapidly changing world.”<br><br> 

According to the inaugural “Best Countries” ranking from U.S. News, the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School and global brand consultants BAV Consulting, the new project ranks 60 countries across 24 categories and is based on a survey of more than 16,000 people. The U.S. ranked first in power and influence, but Sweden was ranked the best country for citizenship, Canada the best country for quality of life, and Germany the best country overall. Does this mean that America is still, as claimed, the “leader of the free world”?<br><br> 

If power and influence don’t earn us the top spot, and the rankings are based on opinion surveys, then by what standard may the United States lay claim to such leadership? Freedom? How so? Right now, polls show that American’s greatest concern is national security and the fear of terror attacks, especially here in the homeland. This apparently is due primarily to the overwhelming news coverage of recent terror-inspired violence around the world as well as in America.<br><br> 

Yet, America has an advantage. The first sentence of its Constitution, the oldest written constitution in the world, dedicates America to freedom as our national purpose. These opening words, known as the Preamble, declare that: “We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.”<br><br>   

It is arguably true that this charter of freedom—with its implicit rights and responsibilities— is at the core of the nation’s growth in prosperity and power over its history. It is also persuasive to consider how a pervasive message of fear can and has undermined that freedom not only for those who live in or near poverty levels, but also those who suffer from maladies of circumstance—health, education, family, career, and more. For them, anxiety can lead to genuine fears about the future. Though we seldom acknowledge it, fear of the future virtually guarantees failure to succeed in it. <br><br> 

The remedy, and there is one, is the expectation of promise. Is America our promised land? If it is somewhere short of that for many, could it be that we are not living up to the promise of the Constitution, that we are not honoring our sacred trust so clearly stated by the founders? Gandhi, a great leader for freedom, had it right when he proclaimed that we must be the change we want to see in the world. Our energies direct our actions. These come from what’s on our minds, how we are feeling. They, in turn, drive our sense of purpose. If our purpose is as it is spoken in the Preamble, that is one thing. If it’s not, that is quite another.<br><br>  

Just as U.S. News, the Wharton School and BAV Consulting have framed their rankings of greatness, the Preamble frames a standard of freedom, not just for Americans, one dare say, but for the world. It is to this prior and more fundamental standard that we must pledge our allegiance, and keep our oath to serve and protect the Constitution.<br><br>  

There is no forbidding reason why American leaders could not build an index of freedom that would measure the quality of life in America according to the standards set forth in the Preamble of the Constitution.<br></p>   

    <h2 class = "opEdHeaders">Freedom is Cool, Not Cruel</h2><br>
        <p class = "opEdBody">Freedom is a meta force that characterizes civilization. America and its allies are en-gaged in a great struggle, often misjudged as a war against terror, which is actually a confrontation of unfreedom by freedom. The basic human rights and responsibilities embedded in the transcendent idea of freedom are distorted by unbalanced minds run amok, engaged in acts of terror and violence, whether foreign or domestic, that destroy rather than create. Terror is cruel. Freedom is cool.<br><br>

According to our Declaration of Independence, "We find these truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inal-ienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness." These thoughts are famous because they are fundamental. America is great because it can create. People must be free to create rather than bound to destroy.<br><br>

This is the doctrine of freedom set forth in the first sentence of the U.S. Constitution, known as the Preamble, which states our national purpose: "We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.” This is our charge as American citizens.<br><br>

What would it take for the cool of freedom to overcome the cruel of terror? For that to happen, our seed of creativity must become a solidarity of purpose that produces the security of strength. For America, this will take a rededication to America’s ideals as ex-pressed in the Preamble, starting with the public debate over current issues headlined in the news about the 2016 presidential campaign.<br><br> 

Every significant issue ought to be addressed in light of these ideals, if we are to make any sense of them. These ideals, of course, are the Supreme Law of the Land. “We the People” are empowered citizens, “a more perfect Union” starts with voting rights, “Jus-tice” is equal opportunity, “domestic Tranquility” means a homeland sanctuary, “the common defence” prevents violent attack, “the general Welfare” produces abundance, “the Blessings of Liberty” enable our humanity, “ourselves and our Posterity” engage the future, “the Constitution” sanctifies the law, and “America” is a unified nation that stands for freedom.<br><br>

If we look at the most pressing issues of today, as reflected by the polls, we can simplify them as four urgent outcomes: for national security, for economic prosperity, for equal protection, and for access to healthcare.<br><br>

Take national security. Would we not debate these issues in light of their meaning for all Americans? For unifying America’s strength? For Americans’ opportunity to get ahead? For their safety from attack? For their capacity to be productive? So they could be secure in their freedom to fight for the right to be people? And do so for their children, as well?<br><br>

Take economic prosperity. Would we not debate these issues for their impact on the entire population in relation to the economy? Make sense of it as a whole? See how well or poorly it is doing for identifiable segments of the population? Check their relationship to the domestic picture? And the influence of international factors? What they mean for productivity? For levels of wealth and poverty? For the future?<br><br>

Take equal protection. How well is law enforcement working in general? National, state or local differences? What are the causes of disturbances and what can be done about them? What effect are they having on quality of life in affected areas? Short range or long range problems?<br><br>        

Take access to healthcare. How well is the system functioning overall? What trends are positive or negative? Are there differences by areas across the country and why? What can be done to improve the quality of care for those in need? Are there ways to improve so that people can be more productive faster? Longer? What are the impacts for our children?<br><br>

Asking these questions will help move us toward civilizing the meta force of freedom that characterizes civilization and leads to creativity. Our response to these questions will affect how well we succeed which, in turn, will add or subtract to America’s reputa-tion as leader of the free world.</p><br>
      <h2 class = "opEdHeaders">The Preamble is Fair and balanced</h2><br>
        <p class = "opEdBody">There is hunger in the country for middle-of-the-road politics and policies, according to news reports. That makes sense in light of the partisan wrangling that dominates much of national speech-making as the 2016 presidential campaign picks up steam. Is there a center point from which the country might regain the nonpartisan resolution of political conflict on which the United States of America was founded?<br><br>

Yes. Check the Constitution—primarily authored by James Madison of Virginia from his detailed notes of the Constitutional Convention’s closed-door proceedings, led by the soon-to-be first President George Washington of Virginia, distinguished by the presence of elder statesmen Ben Franklin of Pennsylvania, drafted by Gouverneur Morris of Pennsylvania, and vigorously promoted by Alexander Hamilton of New York in what came to be known as the Federalist Papers.<br><br>

This revered document is the oldest written constitution in the history of the world. For America, it is the supreme law of the land. Its first sentence is called the Preamble. It states our national purpose. In doing so, it identifies our sacred values.<br><br>

As the words were written by our founders, it says: “We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.” <br><br>

All of the headlined issues we are debating across the country should be considered in light of these founding words and framing ideals. How do they speak to Americans today, as we look back at them and look forward to the future amid the maelstroms of the present? What do they mean for we Americans as a people? Impossible to know? Too complicated? Simply not so.<br><br>

If Amazon, for example, can create a widely-reported computer-based information bank of metrics that enables it to plot strategy for its cloud-centered business—not a new phenomenon for ambitious enterprises—then why can’t the United States of America create a Preamble-centered computer model that connects both existing and new sets of performance indicators of America’s progress, or lack thereof.<br><br> 

If the weather systems engulfing Planet Earth can produce the so-called butterfly effect, famously identified by Edward Lorenz, from which a tornado in Texas can emerge from the flapping wings of a butterfly in Tokyo, then why not bring the butterfly back to Washington (where Lorenz first announced it) and give it some national status? His point was, and is, that initial conditions lead to eventuating circumstances.<br><br> 

The moral of the story is that we must pay attention to those conditions. if we don’t like them, if they don’t meet our standards of performance, then we change them. When we decide to change them, we have mechanisms in place to make those changes. When those mechanisms don’t work, we fix them. Because we need to get the job done. This is what we all do as individuals. This is what we expect from business, government, and civic enterprise of every kind. Presumably, we all expect that of America.<br><br>

But, can America produce on its promise? Isn’t productivity at the heart of the Preamble’s intention? How can we produce as a nation if we aren’t able to? How can we produce if we don’t use every possible resource we have at our disposal? So, what are our resources? According to law, they begin with the people themselves. Resources are what the people make of what they have.<br><br> 

When Charlie Rose asked Vladimir Putin what he thought of the United States, Mr. Putin spoke about our creativity. When Thomas Jefferson composed the Declaration of Independence he proclaimed creativity. When the United States rose in the world from thirteen independent states to fifty United States, it did so through creativity. Creativity produces. and productivity is our bellwether.<br><br> 

We are not creative, nor productive, when we are name-calling. Mindlessness did not elevate America to greatness. Whatever our definition of greatness may be, it is something that mindfulness makes meaningful. Americans urgently need to put hearts and minds together to determine what that means.<br><br>     
      <h2 class = "opEdHeaders">Mandate For Freedom</h2><br>
        <p class = "opEdBody"> The idea of America is freedom. That’s what the Constitution is about. But the surprising results of the Iowa Caucus give us two different versions of freedom. One comes from the Republican defeat of Donald Trump by Ted Cruz who is for smaller government. The other comes from the Democrat’s virtual tie of Hillary Clinton by Bernie Sanders who is for larger government.<br><br>

To keep us free, the Constitution begins with a Preamble that introduces the idea. It says: “We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.”<br><br>

Actually, scholars seem to interpret the founders intent to be some form of limited government. Yet the outcome in Iowa raises profound questions about the role and scope of all government in the life of our nation. Only a reconsideration of the words found in the Preamble can lead to a satisfactory answer. What do these words mean for America today? Take a look, for example, at four distinct sets of issues that polls tell us are among those at the top of the public mind.<br><br>

First, national security. This concerns all Americans, one way or another. It would certainly require all of our unified strength. That would necessitate our safety from attack. We would need everyone to be as productive as possible. We would need them to be as usefully able in all walks of American life as they could be. Our efficiency as a nation would have to be as imperfectly perfect as we can make it. So we would need to be both effective and economical at the same time.<br><br> 

Second, economic prosperity. This concerns the entire economy and, therefore, our entire population. Where are we strong or weak? What is moving us forward or holding us back? Which segments of the economy and the population are doing well or poorly and why? To what extent are the most influential factors domestic or global? What do they mean for the creation of wealth or stagnation?<br><br>  

Third, equal protection. How well is law enforcement working in general, from federal to local levels? Are people feeling more afraid or more free to go about their everyday lives? Do they think their opportunities to get ahead are opening or closing? For themselves? For their kids? Are there areas of the country that need special help? What combination of efforts, private and public, are needed to recharge their batteries?<br><br> 

Fourth, personal well-being. How relevant are the pursuits of life, liberty and happiness to people in all walks of American life. Are families coming together, staying together, and prospering together? Do people have access to the services they need to be healthy, get a good education, enjoy adequate shelter, and find a decent job? Are they encouraged, all of them, to serve the nation in some concerted way for at least some period of time, somewhere somehow? After all, we need everyone to be part of the solution to avoid being part of the problem.<br><br>

What does the Preamble teach us today? Do “We the People” include all citizens? Does “a more perfect Union” refer to a nation of united states? Does “establish Justice” confer equality according to law? Does “insure domestic Tranquility” enable a degree of calm where we live and work? When we “provide for the common defence,” are we protected from undue harm? When we “promote the general Welfare,” does it help us achieve the productivity we should? Do we more often than not “secure the Blessings of Liberty” we think we deserve? For “ourselves and our Posterity,” as well?<br><br> 

If our answers to these questions are not as satisfactory as we would like them to be, personally or generally, then we should ask ourselves which presidential candidate is most likely to lead a limited—but more effective and efficient—government throughout the nation as a whole.<br><br>

When we consider the candidates, let’s also ask ourselves what we actually know about the character and experience of each one? When we elect one of them, we will also be helping to elect the next Congress, and even the next Supreme Court, as well. In fact, won’t we also be electing the next “leader of the free world?”</p><br>
