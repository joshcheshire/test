        <h2 class = "outtakesTitle"> Notable Out Takes: A Back Story</h2><br>

                <h2 class= "outtakes">From <em><strong>PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN</em></strong>—honorary chairman of the Shakespeare Globe Centre of North America while I was its executive director—a warm handshake and a pat on the back outside his office in LA while we waited off camera for a video shoot to promote our program of classical theater across the country. I barely had time to brief him on his lines as he spun favorite tales of good times with British friends. Reagan was fundamentally internationalist as was Shakespeare.<br><br>

                From the billionaire insurance executive<strong><em>AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP CEO MAURICE “HANK” GREENBERG</strong></em>—chairman of the Trustee development committee at the Center for Strategic and International Studies while I was its vice president for development—a personal promise to take the lead of the Center’s expansive new development program. He invited me into his office and offered a chair before an arc of computers on his desk by which he monitored the operations of his subsidiaries across the world. AIG was the world’s largest insurance company and he was CSIS’s most generous supporter.<br><br>

                From<em> ZULU CHIEFTAIN MANGOSUTHU BUTHELEZI</em>—President of the Inkatha Freedom Party, noted for his efforts for interracial reconciliation, and later the Minister of Homeland Affairs in Nelson Mandela’s first South African government—fascinating insights about the racial conflicts still unresolved in the lead-up to Mandela’s historic release from imprisonment, shared in private conversations before receiving an honorary degree from The University of Tampa where I served as president.<br><br>

                From<em> AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED KINGDOM ANNE ARMSTRONG</em>—chair of the CSIS board of trustees and also chair of the President’s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board at the White House—a check for $100,000 from a corporate donor that she handed me during a CSIS board meeting in Washington where she was formerly introducing the Center’s plans for development for which I was the responsible staff officer. She was invariably all business in diplomacy, industry and defense policy research, and this was no exception.<br><br>

                From<em> FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN PAUL VOLCKER</em>- later chairman of President Obama’s Economic Recovery Advisory Board—who had accepted the chairmanship of the CSIS Advisory Board, which was one of my staffing responsibilities—an economist’s view of the critical relationship between the perception of credit and the assignment of value in the making of investment decisions by financial and political leaders. He was methodical, patient and unrelenting in his questioning of the briefing points.<br><br>

                From<em> FLORIDA GOVERNOR BOB GRAHAM</em>—while I was at UT and a member of his Florida Council of 100, then later U.S. Senator and chairman of its Select Committee on Intelligence when the 9-11 terror attacks occurred and continuing on through the lead-up to the Iraq War—focussed concern for the relationship of education and enterprise at all levels and in all sectors, always with a seemingly unfailing memory for personal names of guests arriving at his home or office, as well as his hosts on the road.<br><br>

                From<em> ACADEMY AWARD-WINNING ACTOR JOSE FERRER</em>—famous for his portrayal of Cyrano de Bergerac, who chaired the actor's committee of the Shakespeare Globe Centre’s board of trustees while I was it’s director—a high energy, clearly spoken message of support for the importance of theater in the life of the world and a tireless willingness to do whatever it takes to serve the cause, always with vision, verve, and  genuine friendship.<br><br>

                From <em>ASTRONAUT SALLY RIDE</em>—the youngest astronaut, first female, and only LGBT person in space, who trained as an optical physicist and served as a university professor, and who was a participant in the CSIS strategic space program while I was its development advisor—a gift for making sense of complicated planetary systems effecting the exploration of space and the future of life on Mother Earth, and who, with a broad smile and firm handshake, was a soft spoken and often underestimated leader from whom we learned a great deal.<br><br>

                From <em>EDWARD TELLER, FATHER OF THE HYDROGEN BOMB</em>—both brilliant and outspoken as a nuclear physicist and natural philosopher, both friend and opponent of Einstein, Hungarian immigrant and long-time director of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, with whom I visited before his speech at UT, and on a bus ride to Cape Kennedy afterward—his unusual perspectives on science and politics affecting war and peace led to the thought of rocket science  and robust leadership as crude partners, at their best.<br><br>

                From <em>KING OF CALYPSO HARRY BELAFONTE</em>—a confidante of Martin Luther King, Jr. who was more than a popular entertainer, of course, but a tireless advocate for people to claim their rights as citizens—his old office across West 57th Street from Carnegie Hall in New York City which became mine when I accepted responsibility for Shakespeare Globe’s operations, and the inspiration his work gave to everyone.<br><br>

                From <em>“TO TELL THE TRUTH” TV GAME SHOW STAR KITTY CARLISLE</em>—who was chair of the New York State Council of the Arts, received the National Medal of the Arts, and was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame— to Shakespeare Globe supporters at a luncheon I hosted for her at which she explained the direct linkage of classical plays with civilized culture, with special emphasis of course on the role of the bard.<br><br>

                From<em> CIA DIRECTOR JIM WOOLSEY</em>—who was legal counsel to our CSIS executive team —constant warnings about the clear and present danger of America’s enemies which his recent remarks about the notorious leaker of American intelligence, Edward Snowden, epitomized: “I’d prefer to see him hang by the neck until he is dead, rather than merely executed.” Treason to one’s country is serious business, though it never got serious discussion while I was there.<br><br>

                From <em>CANADIAN NOVELIST AND POET MARGARET ATWOOD</em>—winner of the Booker Prize for best novel in the English language published in the United Kingdom and the Arthur C. Clarke Award for best Science Fiction- a charming presentation of prose and poetry to an enraptured community audience unused to hearing such soaring words, and our special guest at a reception afterward for adoring fans of her work in writing, teaching and advocacy.<br><br>

                From <em>PRIME MINISTER HAROLD WILSON OF THE UNITED KINGDOM</em>— head of government and leader of the Labour Party, who emphasized opportunity through education allied with the aim of taking better advantage of rapid scientific progress, including membership in the European Communities—who visited UT for a Commencement Address and was both an informative speaker on international affairs, but also a witty conversationalist over sumptuous dining.</h2>
