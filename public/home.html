                            This was the conclusion of a 68-year-old grandmother in Nashville, Tennessee, Linda McFadyen-Ketchum, who spoke to the New York Times after the mass shootings in San Bernadino, California on Dec 2. "I despise having to plan an exit strategy for myself every time I go anywhere, but I do. I want to be ready to run when I hear the first shot. Some might call me 'hyper-sensitized', but I call myself prepared and realistic. No one is safe in America." (" 'I Think About It Daily': Life in a Time of Mass Shootings" by Liam Stack Dec 3, 2015 NYT)<br><br>

                            For America, a nation on alert against domestic and foreign terror, that fear is on the minds of many people today. I grew up during WWII in Hempstead, New York on Long Island, near Mitchell Air Force Base which had a prisoner of war camp next door. I remember three fatal pilot training crashes in the village. We had regular air raid training drills when families took shelter in their basements. My grandmother ran a boarding house a few blocks away for 'fly boys' allowed to live off base. We were not afraid. We were determined to fight back.<br><br>

                            On September 8, 1974 my brother was killed by a Palestinian terrorist bomb while co-piloting a TWA flight from Tel Aviv to New York in which all 88 aboard were lost. We were angry and wanted to fight back. I was later asked to help organize a campaign to secure American friends for the "Arab University of Jerusalem." I agreed, in honor of my brother's loss, because I saw it as part of a fight for freedom by the Palestinian people to rid themselves of oppression.<br><br>

                            A mighty fight for freedom is America's exit strategy to overcome the fear of domestic and foreign terror that dominates the news today. When America declared the "War of Independence" in 1776, Americans fought to free themselves from the autocracy of King George. When Americans adopted the first written Constitution in the history of the world in 1789, its first words, stated in the Preamble, were for what became a democracy of freedom. When Americans fought the Civil War, it was a victory of freedom from slavery in 1865. When, in 1991, the Soviet Union succumbed in the ending of the Cold War, it was a victory for America and the free world.<br><br>

                            Our mandate all along has been to keep us free. We cannot be safe without first being free to fight for it, and that is what keeps us safe. When Francis Scott Key wrote of America as "the land of the free and the home of the brave," he was linking the courage of bravery to the cause of freedom. That is what we must do. To keep us free will not be possible unless we are brave. When we turn to our safety, then, we will be turning to it with all our strength at the ready. To be free of unfreedom is the first and ultimate step of being safe from unsafety.<br><br>

                            Where do we start? By going to the first fact of law in America which is the Preamble of the U.S. Constitution. This is where we will find our national purpose and also America's DNA. This helps us understand that we are not in a war of civilizations so much as we are in a fight for civility itself. This fight begins with the Preamble's mandate "to secure the Blessings of Liberty, to ourselves and our Posterity." This is the message we honor in the Constitution.<br><br>

                            We begin our game plan here. Please join me in doing that. Thank you very much for joining the fight for freedom.<br><br>
