Both national party platforms should pledge "To Keep Us Free" by adopting it as the basis of whatever conservative or liberal policies they propose."<br>-Dr. Richard D. Cheshire</h3></p>

                            <h3 class = "aboutBody">  Dick Cheshire's career history is in transformative leadership as president and professor at The University of Tampa, author of "Leading by Heart" about quantum leap turn-arounds, and a co-founder of the Council for the Advancement and Support of Education in Washington DC. He teaches that winning hearts and minds works by the same principles in macro-international affairs as in micro-interpersonal relations.</h3>
